## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd bookbot
   ```

2. Install dependencies for PDF support:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Install shell commands (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. For basic text analysis only, no additional dependencies required!

## Usage

### Shell Commands (After installing with `./install.sh`)

```bash
# Analyze any file
bookbot <file>

# PDF management
pdf-get --list                    # List PDFs on Windows Desktop
pdf-get --analyze "python"        # Copy and analyze PDF
pdf-get --copy "docker"           # Copy PDF only
pdf-get --copy-all                # Copy all PDFs
```

### Direct Python Usage

```bash
# Text files
python3 main.py <path_to_text_file>

# PDF files  
python3 main.py <path_to_pdf_file>

# PDF transfer utility
python3 pdf_transfer.py --list
python3 pdf_transfer.py --analyze "learning python"
```

### Real-World Examples

```bash
# Quick executive analysis of a technical book
pdf-get --analyze "system design"
# Output: 46,006 words, 3h 4m - 5h 6m reading time
# Key concepts: HTTP, API, Load Balancer, Consistency, CDN

# Analyze your O'Reilly collection
pdf-get --list                          # See all available PDFs
pdf-get --analyze "designing data"      # Finds "Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
pdf-get --copy "machine learning"       # Copy without analyzing

# Traditional file analysis
bookbot books/frankenstein.txt          # Classic literature analysis
bookbot pdfs/some-manual.pdf           # Any PDF analysis

# Batch operations
pdf-get --copy-all                      # Copy all PDFs for offline analysis
```

## How It Works

### Architecture Overview

BookBot uses a modular design with clear separation of concerns:

- **main.py**: Entry point, file handling, PDF extraction, executive reporting
- **stats.py**: Statistical analysis, key concept extraction, executive insights  
- **pdf_transfer.py**: Windows/WSL PDF discovery and transfer utility
- **Shell Scripts**: `bookbot` and `pdf-get` provide Unix-style command experience
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python dependencies for PDF processing

### Executive Analysis Pipeline

1. **File Discovery**: Robust scanning of Windows Desktop locations (including OneDrive variants)
2. **Content Extraction**: 
   - Text files: Direct reading with UTF-8 encoding
   - PDF files: `pdfplumber` library extracts text from all pages
3. **Intelligence Analysis**:
   - **Word Counting**: Accurate tokenization accounting for technical terms
   - **Reading Time**: Dynamic calculation based on content complexity
   - **Technical Detection**: Pattern matching for programming concepts
   - **Key Concepts**: Extraction of technologies, frameworks, methodologies
4. **Executive Reporting**: Professional format optimized for decision-makers

### Advanced Features Explained

#### PDF Text Extraction
- Uses `pdfplumber` for reliable text extraction from technical PDFs

- **Symlink Management**: Unix-style command installation

## Adding Content to Analyze

### For PDFs (Recommended)
1. **O'Reilly Books**: Place PDFs in your Windows Desktop or Desktop/Library folder
2. **Use pdf-get**: The tool automatically discovers and copies them
3. **Analyze**: `pdf-get --analyze "book name"` handles everything automatically

### For Text Files (Classic Method)
1. **Project Gutenberg**: Download free classics in `.txt` format
2. **Save to books/**: Place files in the `books/` directory  
3. **Analyze**: `bookbot books/filename.txt`

### Popular Technical Books to Try
- **System Design**: Alex Xu's System Design Interview
- **Data Engineering**: Designing Data-Intensive Applications
- **AI/ML**: Any O'Reilly AI or Machine Learning book
- **Programming**: Language-specific O'Reilly guides (Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- **DevOps**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS books

### Classic Literature (for comparison)
- **Pride and Prejudice**: `https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1342/1342-0.txt`
- **Alice in Wonderland**: `https://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt` 
- **Moby Dick**: `https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-0.txt`

## Technical Details

### Dependencies
- **Core:** Python 3.8+ (no external packages for basic text analysis)
- **PDF Support:** pdfplumber, pillow, nltk (auto-installed via `./install.sh`)

- **Analysis speed:** Optimized with curated technical term matching
- **PDF processing:** Efficient page-by-page text extraction
- **Cross-platform:** Seamless Windows/WSL file system integration

### File Format Support
- **Text files:** .txt with UTF-8 encoding (handles international characters)
