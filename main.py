BookBot - A Text Analysis Tool for PDFs and Executive Analysis

This program analyzes text files and PDFs (like O'Reilly books) and provides:
- Total word count and reading time estimates
- Character frequency analysis
- Key concepts and technical terms extraction
- Executive summary with actionable insights

Usage: python3 main.py <path_to_book>
Example: python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt
Example: python3 main.py oreilly_books/learning_python.pdf
