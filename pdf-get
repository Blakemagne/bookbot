# pdf-get - Shell wrapper for PDF transfer utility  
# Usage: pdf-get [options]
#
# LEARNING NOTE: This shell script demonstrates the same concepts as 'bookbot':
# 1. Professional command-line tool creation
# 2. Automatic environment setup
# 3. Cross-platform file handling (Windows/WSL integration)
# 4. User-friendly command interfaces
# 5. Robust path resolution
#
# This script enables executives to quickly grab PDFs from their Windows
# Desktop and analyze them with a single command like: pdf-get --analyze "docker"

# BEGINNER CONCEPT: Script location detection (same pattern as bookbot)
# This ensures the script works from anywhere in the file system
SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$(readlink -f "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")")" && pwd)"

# BEGINNER CONCEPT: Automatic dependency management
# The virtual environment contains all the PDF processing libraries
if [ -d "$SCRIPT_DIR/.venv" ]; then
    source "$SCRIPT_DIR/.venv/bin/activate"
fi

# BEGINNER CONCEPT: Working directory setup
# Ensures the script can find the pdfs/ directory and other resources
cd "$SCRIPT_DIR"

# BEGINNER CONCEPT: Transparent command forwarding
# Users don't need to know this is a Python script - it feels like a native command
# Examples: pdf-get --list, pdf-get --analyze "python", pdf-get --copy-all
python3 "$SCRIPT_DIR/pdf_transfer.py" "$@"
